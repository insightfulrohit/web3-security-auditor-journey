###What is Blockchain?
You can say
Blockchain = A tamper-proof digital ledger where data is stored in "blocks" and linked in a chain using cryptography.

###
° A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger that records **transactions** across a network of computers.

**Transactions?**
Type	                        | Stores in Blockchain         |    How?
Text (transaction details)	        ✔️ Yes	                    Direct store
Money transfer record	              ✔️ Yes	                    Direct store
Smart contract code	                ✔️ Yes	                    Direct store
Image, PDF, video	                  ❌ Not Directly 	          Only hash store + file IPFS
Identity proof	                    ❌ Not Directly	            Hash + metadata

**Why image/pdf/id not directly?**
Becuase the purpose of blockchain is to make secure ledgers, not storage system.
If people's store videos, images, movies inside the blockchain then:
  ->Blockchain is going to too heavy
  ->Network slowdown
  ->Validation time will be increased
###
° Data is stored in blocks, which are chronologically linked togethers using cryptography, creating a secure and transparent chain of information.
This structure makes the data **tamper-proof**, as altering one block would require changing all subsequesnt blocks and gaining network **consensus**.

## Consensus (Simple Definition)

**Consensus means agreement.**  
In blockchain, all computers (called *nodes*) must agree that a transaction is valid before it gets added to the blockchain.

No single person controls the network — **everyone verifies.**

---

## Why Consensus Is Needed?

- Prevents fraud or double-spending  
- Ensures all nodes trust the same version of data  
- Enables decentralized decision-making

---

## 🧠 Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine **5 friends** are keeping track of trip expenses.

One friend says:

> "Rahul paid ₹500 for dinner."

Before writing it in the shared notebook, all 5 friends verify:

- Did Rahul actually pay?
- Is there any proof? (bill, message, UPI screenshot)
- Does everyone agree with this entry?

✅ If **everyone says YES**, the entry is added.  
❌ If some say **NO**, the entry is rejected.

➡️ This verification and agreement process is called **consensus**.

---

## 🏗️ Blockchain Example

> "Alice sends 0.5 BTC to Bob."

All nodes in the blockchain network check:

- Does Alice have at least 0.5 BTC balance?
- Is Alice’s digital signature valid?
- Does the transaction follow the protocol rules?

✅ If the **majority of nodes agree**, the transaction is added to the blockchain.  
❌ If not, the transaction is rejected.

---

## Summary

> **Consensus** is the process where blockchain nodes agree on which transactions are valid and can be added to the blockchain.

OR
"A blockchain is just a shared ledger, a shared record of all of the transaction and these transactions are grouped together in 
blocks where each block is mathematicallly linked to get the pervious block through cryptography and it's maintained and control 
by decentralized networks of participants called _nodes_."
