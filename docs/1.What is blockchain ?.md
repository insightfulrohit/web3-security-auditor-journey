## What is Blockchain?

_Note_: This repo has lot's of definition. According to your understanding read, and go with any one.

So You can say  
**Blockchain = A tamper-proof digital ledger where data is stored in "blocks" and linked in a chain using cryptography.**

---

### A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger that records **transactions** across a network of computers.

---

### Transactions?

| Type                        | Stores in Blockchain | How?                                |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Text (transaction details) | ✔️ Yes                | Direct store                          |
| Money transfer record      | ✔️ Yes                | Direct store                          |
| Smart contract code        | ✔️ Yes                | Direct store                          |
| Image, PDF, video          | ❌ Not Directly       | Only hash store + file IPFS           |
| Identity proof             | ❌ Not Directly       | Hash + metadata                       |

### Why image/pdf/id not directly?

Because the purpose of blockchain is to make secure ledgers, not a storage system.

If people store videos, images, movies inside the blockchain then:

- Blockchain becomes too heavy  
- Network slowdown  
- Validation time increases  

---

### Data is stored in blocks, which are chronologically linked together using cryptography, creating a secure and transparent chain of information.

This structure makes the data **tamper-proof**, as altering one block would require changing all subsequent blocks and gaining network **consensus**.

---

## Consensus (Simple Definition)

**Consensus means agreement.**  
In blockchain, all computers (called *nodes*) must agree that a transaction is valid before it gets added to the blockchain.

No single person controls the network — **everyone verifies.**

---

## Why Consensus Is Needed?

- Prevents fraud or double-spending  
- Ensures all nodes trust the same version of data  
- Enables decentralized decision-making  

---

## 🧠 Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine **5 friends** are keeping track of trip expenses.

One friend says:

> "Rahul paid ₹500 for dinner."

Before writing it in the shared notebook, all 5 friends verify:

- Did Rahul actually pay?  
- Is there any proof? (bill, message, UPI screenshot)  
- Does everyone agree with this entry?  

✔️ If **everyone says YES**, the entry is added.  
❌ If some say **NO**, the entry is rejected.

➡️ This verification and agreement process is called **consensus**.

---

## 🏗️ Blockchain Example

> "Alice sends 0.5 BTC to Bob."

All nodes in the blockchain network check:

- Does Alice have at least 0.5 BTC balance?  
- Is Alice’s digital signature valid?  
- Does the transaction follow the protocol rules?  

✔️ If the **majority of nodes agree**, the transaction is added to the blockchain.  
❌ If not, the transaction is rejected.

---

## Summary

> **Consensus** is the process where blockchain nodes agree on which transactions are valid and can be added to the blockchain.

## OR

"A blockchain is just a shared ledger, a shared record of all of the transactions and these transactions are grouped together in blocks where each block is mathematically linked to the previous block through cryptography and it's maintained and controlled by decentralized networks of participants called *nodes*."
## OR
Blockchain is a distributed and secure way of storing data.
It consists of multiple blocks (you can imagine them as “boxes”) where each block stores a group of transactions or records.

When one block becomes full, a new block is added to the chain.
Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptographic hashes, creating a chain of interconnected blocks — and this continuous linking is why it is called a Blockchain.

Because every block is connected and secured using cryptography, and because the blockchain is stored across many computers (nodes), the data becomes tamper-proof, transparent, and highly secure.


## **Examples of Blockchain**

### **1. Bitcoin**

* Bitcoin uses blockchain to record all BTC transactions.
* Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, the transaction goes into a block.

### **2. Ethereum**

* Ethereum uses blockchain not only for transactions but also for running **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (DApps)**.

### **3. Supply Chain Tracking**

* Companies use blockchain to track products from manufacturing → shipping → delivery.
* Example: Tracking a medicine bottle to ensure it's not fake.

### **4. Voting Systems**

* Blockchain can create **tamper-proof digital voting** where votes cannot be altered.

### **5. Land/Property Records**

* Governments store land registry records on blockchain to prevent fraud or tampering.

### **6. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**

* Digital art, game items, music, etc. are stored on blockchain as NFTs.

### **7. Banking & Finance**

* Banks use blockchain for fast cross-border payments (e.g., Ripple).

### **8. Identity Management**

* Blockchain can store digital identity securely (ID, certificates, documents).

### **9. Healthcare**

* Hospitals use blockchain to securely store and share patient records.

### **10. Smart Contracts**

* Programs stored on Ethereum-based blockchains that execute automatically.
  Example: Auto-release payment when product is delivered.
