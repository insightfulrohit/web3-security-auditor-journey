### **What is Blockchain?**

Blockchain is a distributed and secure way of storing data.
It consists of multiple blocks (you can imagine them as “boxes”) where each block stores a group of transactions or records.

When one block becomes full, a new block is added to the chain.
Each block is linked to the previous one using cryptographic hashes, creating a chain of interconnected blocks — and this continuous linking is why it is called a Blockchain.

Because every block is connected and secured using cryptography, and because the blockchain is stored across many computers (nodes), the data becomes tamper-proof, transparent, and highly secure.


### **Examples of Blockchain**

### **1. Bitcoin**

* Bitcoin uses blockchain to record all BTC transactions.
* Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, the transaction goes into a block.

### **2. Ethereum**

* Ethereum uses blockchain not only for transactions but also for running **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (DApps)**.

### **3. Supply Chain Tracking**

* Companies use blockchain to track products from manufacturing → shipping → delivery.
* Example: Tracking a medicine bottle to ensure it's not fake.

### **4. Voting Systems**

* Blockchain can create **tamper-proof digital voting** where votes cannot be altered.

### **5. Land/Property Records**

* Governments store land registry records on blockchain to prevent fraud or tampering.

### **6. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**

* Digital art, game items, music, etc. are stored on blockchain as NFTs.

### **7. Banking & Finance**

* Banks use blockchain for fast cross-border payments (e.g., Ripple).

### **8. Identity Management**

* Blockchain can store digital identity securely (ID, certificates, documents).

### **9. Healthcare**

* Hospitals use blockchain to securely store and share patient records.

### **10. Smart Contracts**

* Programs stored on Ethereum-based blockchains that execute automatically.
  Example: Auto-release payment when product is delivered.
