# Blockchain Basics

**Repo:** blockchain-basics

## Purpose
This repository collects concise, practical explanations of core blockchain concepts. Intended as a study log and a small public portfolio showing fundamental understanding.
A beginner-friendly repository covering the fundamentals of blockchain technology. Includes clear explanations of ledgers, hashing, blocks, nodes, wallets, consensus mechanisms, transactions, and real-world use cases. Perfect for learners starting their blockchain journey.

## Daily — Summary
Today I organized core concepts learned from videos and notes. The goal was to convert scattered topics into a structured study repository.

### Topics covered (short definitions)
- **Ledger** — The immutable record of transactions. Properties: *append-only, tamper-evident, shared*.  
- **Node** — A machine participating in the network. Types: *full node* (stores full ledger & validates), *partial/light node* (stores subset).  
- **Wallet** — Stores private keys and signs transactions. Types: *hot* (connected online), *cold* (offline).  
- **Nonce & Hash** — A nonce is a number used once to alter block hash; the hash is a deterministic fingerprint of block data.  
- **Merkle Tree** — A binary-hash tree enabling efficient integrity checks of many transactions.  
- **Types of Blockchain** — *Public, Private, Consortium* — trade-offs include decentralization vs control.  
- **Consensus** — Mechanism to agree on the next block. Examples: *Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)*.  
- **Protocols** — Rules that define network, block format, consensus, propagation.  
- **Benefits & Limitations** — High-level pros (transparency, tamper-resistance) and cons (scalability, energy, governance).
